                                Ken Burton is a recent alumnus who has developed a very interesting suite of related products. He is looking for help testing them. The internship is unpaid but you'll gain great experience designing, 
                                documenting, and implementing engineering tests in electrical engineering and thermodynamics. Experience dealing with battery technology and wiring electrical circuits are plusses. If you are interested 
                                and willing to sign a non-disclosure agreement (a very common practice in product development circles), please contact Ken at kennethab27@gmail.com.
